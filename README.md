## Using the dev version

This git repo deliberately DOES NOT contain third party libraries (and if it does now, it won't soon).

Dependencies are managed with bower. If you have never used it before, you will need to:

* Install nodejs (and npm - which should come with it)
* Install bower: `npm install -g bower`
* Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* Go to the weathermap checkout directory
* `bower install` should install all the necessary javascript dependencies to the vendor/ directory.
* `composer update` will grab the PHP dependencies for both the runtime and testing environments
The release process collects up these files and puts them in the zip file, via the packing.list file(s). You only need to do this if you are working with the current development code.

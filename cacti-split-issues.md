# Outstanding Issues

## Editor

Cacti picker is blank

~~Timestamp and Title are in Imagemap, but don't make it into the HTML(? - only Z=1000 items)~~

~~BWlabels have no imagemap box (:2 and :3 _do_ exist, but don't "work") - bwlabel boxes are 1 pixel wide~~

~~font samples is a black box~~

~~Map Style has a strange orange box at the bottom??~~

~~lagged imagemap?~~

Feature: "Lock to" list for nodes shouldn't really include itself

Feature: Via overlay should include an arrowhead

Config editing all appears on a single line.
